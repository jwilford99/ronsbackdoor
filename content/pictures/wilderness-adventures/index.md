> ## *"Worthless as tits on a boar hog"*

I often catch myself saying to myself, "Self, don't forget what your father told you when you were young..."  

Well, now that I'm retired, I share the wise words taught to me by my dad with my own sons...and everyone else who will listen.

> ### *"Boy you better look out, I'll tie a knot in your tail."*

I think these white-tailed deer must have heard that "Ronism" because they sure didn't want their tails tied in a knot!

> ### *"Grant me this favor and I'll Dance at your wedding"*

If I had a dime for every time I've seen this quote etched into a truckstop bathroom stall, I'd have at least 70 cents. Needless to say, I know how to cut a rug and weave it back together like a pro.

> ### *"Boy, your mamma's gonna tell ya how the cow eats corn"*

Well, I know how I eat corn: one bite at a time.  Kind of like how I catch fish...I bait my rod until that worm is stiff on that hook.  Is there any other way to do it?

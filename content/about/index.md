Hi, I am Ron, first time blogger, long time reader. I work in technology and work with a team of guys that will never pass up an opportunity to crack a joke at my expense after an unfortunate choice of words. It's like I can’t tell them a single story, that I should have known better to not tell them, and not have them make jokes about it for the next three years. I love the outdoors. I often tell fish stories, show off the fish mounted on my wall, and tell the story about the fat lady on the donkey. People say I look like Santa, but I don’t see the resemblance. Have a nice day.
